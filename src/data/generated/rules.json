Emperor Galen Halcyon IV could not hold together what nearly a thousand years of effort and bloodshed had built; the collapse happened almost overnight. Civil war swept through what had once been a united galaxy, dozens of once-prosperous worlds were wiped clean of life, cleansing fire rained down from orbiting ships. In the span of less than a decade, over one tenth of the galaxy’s population died. Through years of in-fighting and power struggles, the mighty fleets of the Halcyon Empire vanished, and the void that was left in the empire’s wake was filled by hundreds of factions each hungry for power. Piracy sprang up and Whisper cults formed as the population of the galaxy tried to make sense of what was happening.",

There might be a healthy population of nanites on an out-of-the-way waystation just outside Whisperspace. A passenger liner might have nanites on board. Most of the time, these little machines are for all intents and purposes inert; their basic instructions don’t give them much to do beyond keeping their population up, and the replication process is purposefully designed to minimize material usage. Its unlikely it would appear to be anything more than the degradation of time; slight wear on a ship’s bulkheads, maybe, where nanites have scavenged metal flakes to replicate, or a strange power fluctuation where they recharge themselves.",

Most often they don’t recognize this connection for anything out of the ordinary, or don’t even notice it at all; but the nanites are aware of them and pay them special attention. If there are a dozen people injured in an accident, nanites may rush to save the one Sensitive in the group, even if their injuries are minor. Sometimes, Sensitives can communicate with nanites, usually without realizing what they are doing. Most often, this happens in times of extreme stress; an injured pilot unable to reach the ship’s throttle to avoid certain death may will the ship to stop… And inexplicably the throttle is pulled back by hundreds or even thousands of microscopic robots.",
