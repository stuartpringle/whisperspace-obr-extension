  - type: paragraph
    text: Attributes are a measurement of how focused on different areas of development
      your character is. For example, an athlete would have a high PHYS, since they’ve
      developed their body primarily. A scientist would likely have a high MENT.
    spans: []
  - type: paragraph
    text: Attributes act as skill categories, are sometimes asked for in the form
      of attribute rolls (such as rolling a reflex check to determine your initiative
      order in combat), and also as a baseline for all skills related to them. No
      skill check can have a result lower than its related attribute.
    spans: []
  - type: paragraph
    text: For example, if your character has a PHYS attribute of 2 but a Powerlift
      of 0, every Powerlift check you roll will have a result of 2 or higher (even
      if you roll a 1 and add -1 from your Powerlift skill, which would normally give
      you a result of 0). This reflects that, although you are not a particularly
      gifted powerlifter, your generally good physique allows you to have some basic
      competence in that area.

        a character’s ability to withstand the incredible strain of dangerous situations.
        This attribute is determined by the following formula:'

    - type: paragraph
      text: Skill levels determine what modifier you add to your skill check roll.
        Except for level 0 skills (completely untrained), you will add your skill
        rank as a modifier to all checks for that skill. For example, a Melee (weapons)
        skill check would entail rolling 1d12 and adding your Melee (weapons) skill
        rank to it.

        text: Your skill rank is simply how many points you’ve put into a skill. So
          if you’ve put 3 points into your Balance skill, it has a skill rank of 3.

      - type: paragraph
        text: A rank 0 skill is considered untrained. When rolling an untrained skill,
          roll with a -1 modifier. This emphasizes the difference between an untrained
          skill (modifier of -1) and a trained skill of rank 1 (modifier of +1).

        skills outside of your chosen Learning Focus (Combat, Education, or Vehicles)
        cannot exceed rank 2.
      spans: []
    - type: paragraph
      text: If you make a skill check using a rank 0 skill within your chosen Learning
        Focus, ignore the usual -1 penalty for untrained rolls. Instead, treat the
        roll as 1d12 + 0.

        is naturally good at (or bad at); they are a measure of who your character
        is. Each inherent skill is tied to one of your character’s attributes. Some
        people have a natural gift when it comes to diffusing a difficult or tense
        situation. Others seem to have a gift for hand-eye coordination, math computation,
        etc. These are things that are inherently a part of a person.
