  - type: paragraph
    text: In some cases, skill checks may be aided by using the right tool for the
      job. If you have a shovel, it is considered to be the right tool for the job
      of digging a hole; it is not the right tool for the job for performing a heart
      transplant. Similarly, a medkit is the right tool for the job for treating a
      character’s wounds, while a ship’s well-stocked medbay may be considered the
      right tool for the job for performing surgery.

    text: In cases where a tool is required but the right tool for the job is unavailable,
      it may be possible to improvise with another tool (GM’s discretion), however
      using improvised tools imposes +1 penalty die on the check.
    spans: []
  - type: paragraph
    text: Sometimes items may specify what jobs they are the right tool for, however
      most often they will not. Whether or not something is the right tool for any
      particular job is meant to be a common-sense judgment call made by the GM; players
      may make suggestions or advocate for uses of tools, but the final decision always
      rests with the GM.

    text: Sometimes things break; other times, they aren’t quite what they need to
      be. Either way, repairing or modifying equipment takes time and the right set
      of tools - not to mention the expertise to use them.

    spans: []
  - type: paragraph
    text: For example, a Streetweave Jacket normally has 5 durability. To repair one
      with only 1 point of durability remaining, the DC would be 10 (6 + 4) as the
      jacket had lost 4 durability.

    text: Each repair check takes 1 hour and consumes 1 material (or one use of the
      repair kit) whether the repair was successful or not. You cannot repair equipment
      above its base durability.
    spans: []
  - type: paragraph
    text: An item with 0 remaining durability cannot be repaired; it is broken. It
      may possibly be used as parts for other repairs (GM discretion). Items which
      have no listed durability can still break or require repairs; these are assumed
      to have a base durability of 4.

    text: Modifying equipment works the same way as repairing equipment, but does
      not require materials other than the modification you wish to install. Only
      advanced and expert modifications require an Engineering check or take longer
      than one action to enact; simple modifications may be done (or undone) mid-combat
      and require no roll, only the use of an action.

    - type: paragraph
      text: Typically a mechanic or expert weaponsmith might charge one tenth the
        item’s cost and take 4 hours per durability point restored. This process can
        often be sped up by paying a higher price. Similarly, they might charge 50
        credits and take 4 hours to make a simple modification, 300 credits and take
        6 hours to make an advanced modification, and 1500 credits and take 2 days
        to make an expert modification. These prices and time costs are provided as
        a baseline; GMs should feel free to increase or decrease them as they see
        fit.
