    text: In some cases, skill checks may be aided by using the right tool for the
      job. If you have a shovel, it is considered to be the right tool for the job
      of digging a hole; it is not the right tool for the job for performing a heart
      transplant. Similarly, a medkit is the right tool for the job for treating a
      character’s wounds, while a ship’s well-stocked medbay may be considered the
      right tool for the job for performing surgery.

    text: Sometimes items may specify what jobs they are the right tool for, however
      most often they will not. Whether or not something is the right tool for any
      particular job is meant to be a common-sense judgment call made by the GM; players
      may make suggestions or advocate for uses of tools, but the final decision always
      rests with the GM.

      text: Typically a mechanic or expert weaponsmith might charge one tenth the
        item’s cost and take 4 hours per durability point restored. This process can
        often be sped up by paying a higher price. Similarly, they might charge 50
        credits and take 4 hours to make a simple modification, 300 credits and take
        6 hours to make an advanced modification, and 1500 credits and take 2 days
        to make an expert modification. These prices and time costs are provided as
        a baseline; GMs should feel free to increase or decrease them as they see
