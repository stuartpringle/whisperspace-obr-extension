  text: Whisperspace is a tabletop roleplaying game system created by Stuart Pringle.
    In this book you will find the core rules of play as well as suggestions on how
    to make the most of them. This book does not include a setting, however it is
    loosely based on a modern or near-future setting and can be adapted for use as
    required.

  text: 'Whisperspace began as an extremely simple system of rules I put together
    when creating one-shot adventures. I wanted the adventures to be system-agnostic
    and I didn’t want to have to put a lot of thought into how to alter existing systems
    to allow me to put together the character archetypes I wanted to include. This
    had the advantage of being useful for players who were unfamiliar with existing
    roleplaying game rulesets to play a new setting easily and quickly. I’ve since
    rebuilt the system from the ground up but I’ve kept the core identity of what
    Whisperspace is: an easy-to-play, simple rule system designed to promote fun,
    quick-paced gameplay and minimize dead time during your gaming sessions.'

  text: 'Todo: bring back empathy somehow to tie into empaths, feats, and execute
    action, look over execute action, new nanomancer field updates to burner, dying
    condition…. Also add cyberware to interact with dying, maybe by rolling cybernetics?
    Or using the cybernetics rank as a modifier, like rounds you can auto-succeed
    a dying check or something.'
